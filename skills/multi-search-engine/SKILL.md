# Multi Search Engine (BigSearch) Skill

## Description
BigSearch is a multi-search engine tool that allows you to use and switch between multiple search engines simultaneously. It includes built-in support for popular engines like Google, DuckDuckGo, YouTube, eBay, GitHub and more, while also allowing custom engines.

## Installation
The skill has already been installed by copying the BigSearch repository to this directory. The main functionality comes from the browser extension, which can be installed separately.

## Usage
BigSearch primarily works as a browser extension, but we can integrate its functionality into OpenClaw in several ways:

1. Using the web interface: http://acsearch.atwebpages.com
2. Using the browser extension (recommended):
   - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/big-search/
   - Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/big-search/ojcnjeigmgjaiolalpapfnmmhdmpjhfb

## Integration with OpenClaw
While BigSearch is primarily a browser extension, we can leverage its capabilities through:

1. The web interface for search queries
2. Browser automation using our browser tool
3. Integration with our existing web_search tool for enhanced multi-engine searching

## Features
- Support for 60+ built-in search engines
- Custom search engine capability
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick access
- Multi-line text search
- Search engine categorization
- Privacy-focused (no data collection)

## How to Use
To perform searches using multiple engines, you can:
1. Use the existing web_search tool for general searches
2. Access the BigSearch web app for manual multi-engine searches
3. Configure browser automation to interact with the extension
